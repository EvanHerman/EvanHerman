### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Evan Herman.

I'm a **software engineer** working @GoDaddy on the WordPress Experience team. I work on, and maintain, a number of open source projects that are used by millions of people around the world.

In my free time I love haging out with my wife, our 8 cats and our 2 dogs. I am an animal lover, I love the outdoors and everything tech.

I currently reside in Lancaster, PA. I love to cook, hike and explore new areas around the city. You can find follow me [Twitter](https://twitter.com/EvanMHerman) or view my website, [https://www.evan-herman.com](https://www.evan-herman.com).
